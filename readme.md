## Overview

PhotoBlocks is a blockchain system built on an image recognition mining system. You can earn coins by taking photos, and you trade coins with others.

## Mining
As with most blockchain systems, PhotoBlocks has a Proof-of-Work implementation.
PhotoBlocks uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition) to implement a Proof-of-Work mechanism based on image recognition.
Clone the [models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) repository. 

## Trading
Trading coins on PhotoBlocks works like other blockchain systems.
