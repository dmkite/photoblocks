## Overview

PhotoBlocks is a blockchain system built on an image recognition mining system. You can earn coins by taking photos, and you trade coins with others.

## Mining
PhotoBlocks uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition) for image recognition.
To use TensorFlow for image classification (Inception trained on ImageNet 2012 Challenge data), clone the [models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) repository. 

## Trading
Trading coins on PhotoBlocks works like other blockchain systems.
